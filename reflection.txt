The controller used in this project serves to establish how the project responds to requests from the client.

In the controller there are several exported/defined routing options.

The controller defines how a 'create' request should check for coordinates and then save a listing.

The controller defines how a 'read' request should return the listings.

The controller defines how a 'update' request should take the update info, overwrite the old info, and save the result.

The controller defines how a 'delete' request should cause the corresponding listing to be deleted.

All of these implemented function exports are then utilized in the express configuration to specify which routing middlewares need to be used upon each request.

The use of middlewares allowed all the routing functionality to be written completely seperately from the config/server functionality.
